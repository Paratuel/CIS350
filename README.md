# CIS350
CIS 350 Term Project - Patrick Dishaw, Sam Essenburg, Laura Young, Nicholas Bushen, Viet Duong

@How I started the project: After Laura's idea to change the look of the app I created a new project, this time selecting the Navigation Drawer Activity (which is where NavigationDrawerFragment.java came from). So I suggest you all do the same. From there you should be able to use the code I have put up so far by editing files that should be created automatically, minus Project.java. That one you will have to make yourself. The xml files are located under res > layout (res > values for strings.xml).
